### secondSplit.html difference for A / B test

For 100% users and with a default rule for 50% on and 50% off, our A / B test differs between light mode and dark mode based on a feature request from part 1. We illustrate this by getting the document body and setting its background color to either a dark color or its original journal background color. This is in the spirit of the dark mode/light mode concept and we have dark mode set to "on" and light mode to "off". 

tl;dr The difference between A / B is setting the document body background color of the site to either dark or its original color implementation.
